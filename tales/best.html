    <h4>Brushing your teeth is a best practice.</h4>
    <p class="fragment">For security, you can't check a list and be done.</p>
    <p class="fragment">You must keep working at it. It is a process, not a one-time task.</p>
    <p class="fragment"> Which is why I hope everyone brushes their teeth. </p>

    <h2> Follow the Drupal Security Team</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On Twitter (twitter.com/drupalsecurity)</li>
        <li>Via email (on your drupal.org user edit page under newsletters)</li>
        <li>Via Web (drupal.org/security and drupal.org/security/contrib)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> If you find a security issue...</h2>
    <p> Or think you find a security issue, report it to the team (security@drupal.org) </p>

    <h2>Security Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A vulnerability is discovered in code.</li>
        <li>An issue is reported to the security team.</li>
        <li>An issue is confirmed to be valid in a supported release eligible for an SA.</li>
        <li> The security team and the maintainer of the code fix the issue.</li>
        <li>A Security Advisory is written and the fix is published. Notifications about the issue go out via
            Twitter/RSS/email.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Common Drupal Vulnerabilities from 2014</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>61 - Cross Site Scripting.</li>
        <li>42 - Access Bypass.</li>

    <h2>Some Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Only use encrypted protocols.</p>
    <p>https/ftps/ssh/etc.</p>
    <p>  Every change you make might impact the security of your site. Therefore, security needs to be in your workflow.</p>
    <p>Use supported versions (Soon time to update Drupal 6)</p>
    <p><b>Take and verify backups.</b></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Keep Your Site Updated</h1>
    <p>Always make sure you update after a security release comes out. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Know Your Risk Level</h2>
    <p>
        Blog vs. complex site. Your blog is likely to be compromised to send spam or to act in part of a bot net.
    </p>
    <p> Your complex site might be compromised for the data it has. </p>
    <p> Security is a balance.</p>
    <P> Is your site a target?</P>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Regulations</h2>
    <h3>PCI, HIPAA, SCADA, XYZ, PDQ</h3>
    <p>You might have legal requirements imposed by the data you keep.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Do not use insecure hosting</h2>
    <p> Use a dedicated Drupal hosting provider.  </p>
    <p> Shared hosting normally runs the webserver as the owner of the file system (cpanel). </p>
    <p> Multiple sites on a server often use a common account for all sites. (www-data, nobody, etc)  </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Do Not Use Multisite</h2>
    <p>Unless you have a deep understanding of apache/nginx and file permissions, multisite is insecure. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Use a Module that Enhances Security in Your Site</h2>
    <p>Paranoia: Locks your site down.</p>
    <p>Security Review: Runs a checklist of items and confirm your site adheres to them.</p>
    <p>Permissions Lock: Finer-grained permissions over what users with 'administer permissions' can do. </p>
    <p>Two-Factor Authentication: Something you know, and something you have.</p>
    <p>Hacked! Tells if code has been changed.</p>
    <p>Password Policy: Enforces strong passwords.</p>

    <h3> Other Security Vulnerabilities</h3>
    <p>While XSS/CSRF/access bypass may be harder to mass attack, then say sql injection, but an attacker can still compromise a site with them.
        The security team  releases SA's on Wednesdays, set time aside to update your sites (or pay someoene to do it for you). </p>
