    <h2>The Tale of the Red Ribbon Hacker</h2>

    <p>Our first tale is about a little online shoe store run by a kind woman named Myrtle.</p>

    <p>From her little online store, she mails shoes around the world, and each shoe box comes tied up in a red ribbon like a box of candy.</p>

    <p>Because Myrtle is no dummy, her website takes customers’ orders and then redirects them to a third party for payments.
        This keeps her site PCI-compliant. And gives Myrtle more time to tie red ribbons into bows — she has nothing to worry about!</p>
    <p>Or does she?</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Myrtle’s Shoe Store website first launched on Nov. 15, 2012.</p>
    <p class='fragment'> The site receives about 3,000 orders per month — that’s a lot of ribbons!</p>
    <p class='fragment'> The dev shop that built the site did not provide support after the site went live. The shoe store also does not have a full-time web person on staff.</p>

    <h2>One Day …</h2>
    <p class='fragment'> The date was March 11th, 2013 </p>

    <p class='fragment'> Myrtle noticed that the shoe store was not receiving any money into its account. Yet, the order volume had not changed. </p>

    <p class='fragment'> She called the credit card company. The company told her they had not seen any orders come through in the past 2 weeks. </p>

    <p class='fragment'> That couldn’t be right.</p>

    <p class='fragment'> She went online and placed an order. All seemed to work as it should.</p>

    <p class='fragment'>Myrtle was so confused, Where was all the money?</p>

    <h2>The Next Day …</h2>

    <p>Myrtle got the help of a website security expert named Jordan Baker, a Drupal detective.</p>
    <p>He found that the shoe store’s payment gateway URL configuration was not pointing to its payment gateway.</p>

    <h2> Author’s Note:</h2>

    <p>
        In a proper configuration, the customer goes to the checkout -> the customer is redirected to the payment gateway on the third-party site -> the customer pays -> and then the customer is redirected back to the merchant site.

    </p>

    <h2>What Happened Next…</h2>

    <p class='fragment'> Somehow the URL for the payment gateway had been changed in the Ubercart configuration.</p>

    <p class='fragment'> Jordan lit a cigarette, narrowed his eyes, and began reviewing the server logs. </p>
    <p class='fragment'>
        There was a POST request on the page to change this URL by someone at the company's IP address.    </p>
    <p class='fragment'>
        And the IP address belonged to Myrtle’s computer!
    </p>

    <h2>What Really Happened …</h2>
    <p class='fragment'> But something was still bothering Jordan. He dug some more and discovered:</p>
    <p class='fragment'> Someone had used a security vulnerability in Ubercart and added Javascript into a field.</p>
    <p class='fragment'> Normally the Javascript would be escaped, but since the site was not patched for SA-CONTRIB-2013-020 - Ubercart - Cross site scripting (XSS), the Javascript executed!</p>
    <p class='fragment'> Poor Myrtle had been framed — by the code. </p>
    <p class='fragment'>Jordan took out his notebook and noted down the Case of the Red Ribbon Hacker. Here is what he wrote.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned </h2>
    <p class='fragment'>Always update your site when the security team releases an update. (https://www.drupal.org/security)</p>
    <p class='fragment'>If you are dealing with sensitive data (such as credit card numbers), make sure you have the staff to do so, otherwise think about outsourcing everything.</p>
    <p class='fragment'> XSS can do a lot of damage.</p>
    <p class="fragment"> Always check your input filters as well</p>
